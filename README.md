# Home automation

This is a personal setup of a Raspberry PI Kubernetes cluster that I'll use
for the purpose of reducing the security of my LAN.

# Step 1: get some Raspberry Pi machines

The first step is to set up a bunch of Raspberry Pi 3B+ machines.
These are cheap, run on PoE electricity, and consume between 2.7W
and 5W of power.

The hardware I use:

 * [UniFi PoE Switch 16 - US-16-150W](https://www.ubnt.com/unifi-switching/unifi-switch-16-150w/)
 * [Raspberry PoE Hat](https://www.welectron.com/Raspberry-Pi-PoE-HAT_3)
 * [Raspberry PI 3B+](https://www.welectron.com/Raspberry-Pi-3-Model-B-Made-in-UK)
 * [Raspberry PI Case](https://www.welectron.com/Raspberry-Pi-Official-Case-Gray-Black)
 * [64Gb MicroSDXC](https://www.welectron.com/SanDisk-Ultra-64-GB-A1-UHS-I-Class-10-microSD_1)

In my case, I aim to have at least 3 of these things running.

Set them up, wire them together.
